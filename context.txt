Brief: 
Create an ESP8266 PlatformIO project which uses the D1 Mini and popular MPU-6050 Accelerometer to track movement of an exercise bike (attached to the pedal). 
We will connect to WiFi using hard-coded ssid and password. There will be pedal rotations stored in LittleFS file. The data will be exposed via web server hosted on ESP8266. 
The project is done with PlatformIO. 

In web server control panel we need to show rotations, and have a re-set button. 

We need a README also with install, usage instructions including D1 Mini and Accelerometer breadboard wiring (in markdown).
